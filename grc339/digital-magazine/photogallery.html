                            <figcaption>In one of the film’s most emotionally resonant visuals, Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy sit side by side atop a skyscraper, gazing into an upside-down cityscape bathed in sunset hues. The minimal composition and soft gradient lighting evoke a quiet moment of reflection amid chaos. The visual inversion of the skyline suggests the disorientation of multiversal existence, while the backlit silhouettes of the characters—rendered with clean comic lines and subtle shading—emphasize their bond and shared alienation. The image’s stillness contrasts with the film’s typical kinetic energy, offering a pause to contemplate identity, connection, and belonging in a world turned upside down.</figcaption>

The low-angle composition emphasizes Miles' confidence and grounded stance, contrasting with the chaotic foreground of spilled groceries and warped perspective. The scene cleverly blends traditional comic textures—like dot shading and sketch-like edges—with 3D digital rendering, reinforcing the film’s layered visual language. Light filters through the shop windows, casting soft shadows while glitch effects ripple subtly across The Spot’s form, emphasizing his unstable, dimension-hopping nature. This frame encapsulates the film’s signature style: vibrant, inventive, and pulsing with narrative tension.</figcaption>

Her face is calm yet unreadable, drawn in a stylized painterly aesthetic with soft shadows and visible brush textures. Behind her, Jessica Drew—confident, grounded, arms crossed—and Peter B. Parker—gentler, protective, cradling his baby daughter—flank her on opposite sides, both partially blurred to emphasize Gwen’s emotional isolation. The deep navy backdrop is webbed with crimson lines, subtly evoking the connective tension of the Spider-Verse. This visually balanced tableau highlights the diversity of spider-identities while underscoring Gwen’s place between them—at once connected and apart.</figcaption>
