                            <p class="color"> A recent wave of AI-generated art has sparked controversy among animation fans, particularly those loyal to the beloved works of Studio Ghibli. At the center of the debate is an AI filter that mimics the signature hand-drawn style of the legendary Japanese animation studio, known for classics like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke. While some users see the tool as a fun creative experiment, others view it as a disrespectful imitation of a deeply artisanal craft.</p>

                                <p class="color"> One of the foundational principles of animation — often overlooked by beginners — is the use of arcs of movement.
